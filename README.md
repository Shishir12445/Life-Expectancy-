# Life-Expectancy-
Life Expectancy Analysis Project
This project analyzes life expectancy data from various countries using SQL for data querying and PowerBI for data visualization. The main objective is to uncover trends and correlations between life expectancy and various factors such as GDP, immunization rates, schooling years, adult mortality, HIV/AIDS prevalence, and alcohol consumption.

Project Objective
To identify trends and correlations in life expectancy data using SQL and PowerBI, providing insights into the factors influencing life expectancy across different countries.

Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

Country: Name of the country.
Year: Year of the data record.
Status: Developed or Developing status of the country.
Life Expectancy: Life expectancy at birth in years.
Adult Mortality: Adult mortality rate (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population).
Alcohol: Per capita alcohol consumption (in litres of pure alcohol).
Polio: Polio immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%).
HIV/AIDS: Deaths per 1000 live births HIV/AIDS (0-4 years).
GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD).
Population: Population of the country.
Schooling: Number of years of schooling.


Key Responsibilities
Data Import and Cleaning:

Imported the dataset into SQL for querying and into PowerBI for visualization.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.

SQL Queries:

Wrote SQL queries to extract relevant data for analysis.
Aggregated data by country, year, and other relevant factors to facilitate detailed analysis.

Data Visualization in PowerBI:

Created an interactive dashboard in PowerBI to visualize the data and uncover insights.
Visualized life expectancy trends, correlations with GDP, immunization rates, schooling years, adult mortality, HIV/AIDS prevalence, and alcohol consumption.
Example Visualizations:
1.Life Expectancy Trends by Country
2.GDP vs. Life Expectancy
3.Immunization Rates vs. Life Expectancy
4.Schooling Years vs. Life Expectancy
5.Adult Mortality vs. Life Expectancy
6.HIV/AIDS Prevalence vs. Life Expectancy
7.Alcohol Consumption vs. Life Expectancy


Key Insights
1.Positive Correlation Between GDP and Life Expectancy: Higher GDP is generally associated with higher life expectancy.
2.Impact of Immunization Rates: Countries with higher immunization rates for diseases like polio and measles tend to have higher life expectancy.
3.Schooling Years: More years of schooling correlate with higher life expectancy.
4.Adult Mortality and HIV/AIDS: Higher adult mortality rates and HIV/AIDS prevalence negatively impact life expectancy.
5.Alcohol Consumption: Patterns of alcohol consumption vary, but excessive consumption can negatively impact life expectancy.
